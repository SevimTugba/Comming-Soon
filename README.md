# Comming-Soon
### About the Project
This project is a simple single Comming Soon page. I take this project idea and visual elements from the https://dev.to/frontendmentor/. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is used in this project. Email input checks if the area is empty or email is valid, and then if it is empty or not valid, it writes an error message.

There is no prerequisites for this project. It is just simple interface. Downloading and run with live server is enough to run the code.
